Explanation of React hooks implementation
I used useState to store and update information.
user: user was authenticated or not
userAnswers :storing user answers and selections
questions: storing returned quiz questions from gemini
loading: for waiting for async stuff
quizComplete :creattion of final results page


useEffect was used for Firebase Auth state changes and fetching user data on when requested to load


Discussion of challenges and solutions
The major challenge I have encountered is working on sending the data to Gemini. I do not know much about how the structure the data to be sent as JSON and readable. I have used ChatGPT to troubleshoot this. I also encountered errors where there was just nothing showing up on the page. To debug this I made console log entries to make sure that data being received was coming in properly and not as null or undefined
I have not yet figured out how to get the evidence/ justification portion into the result page. If I have time I would also work on adding a time filter. 


Summary of progress
I have so far made the pages for signin, home, journal, and quiz pages. When the user signs in they will be directed to a home page where they can either start the quiz or create a journal entry. The journal entries are stored in the firestore database under the userâ€™s unique id value. The quiz app then pulls the data from the user database and then send that data Gemeni flash 1.5 AI API with a specific prompt. The AI creates a quiz question based on the data and then also generates 3 false questions. Next I will work on the results page and improve the UI of the Quiz page.
