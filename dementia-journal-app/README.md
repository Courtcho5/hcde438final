Project overview and purpose:
The purpose of this web app was to create a memory aid tool for users at risk of dementia-related conditons. Users can sign up/sign in to their account to create daily journal entries. The entries are then used to create AI generated quiz questions. These quiz questions are personalized to the user's life. Below each question are multiple choice options, with one correct answer. After the user completes the quiz their results will be displayed with justification from the entry they wrote.

Setup and installation instructions
To use the web app sign up for an account on the signup page and navigate to journal to make your first entry. Then you can go to quiz to generate questions based on the entries you have submitted.

Future enhancements or known issues
- Progress bar lags when updating the quiz completion progress
- Quiz easy mode is prone to errors due to timestamp used.


Reflection: 

Throughout this project I learned the essential skills associated with web development. Previous to this class I was unfamiliar with how to host my own website using third-party databases. In previous classes I commonly hosted on github but being able to now use firebase is a great resource to have. I also learned about the connections between html, css, jsx, and json files. In previous classes, I barely grasped these concepts as it was not the main focus of the course. My knowledge of react hooks also improved. 

In future projects I would begin the development process differently. When I started my final, I had not properly defined the scope of many of my features. This led me to have a rather unstructured process that resulted in me jumping around and working on different pages and also being unsatisfied with the final result. I would like to define a minimum viable product next time and spend more time considering the features I really want and what would be nice to have.

Through this course I have also drawn much inspiration from my peers and their ideas. For example, the Wordlet project introduced me to the possibility of multiplayer interaction. I didn't even know that firebase was capable of hosting multiplayer communication. I think as an exercise in the future I will try and recreate his project to familiarize myself with the topic before moving forward with my own ideas. Additionally, I was also inspired by my classmates and their various uses for APIs. For example, Athenaâ€™s project involving the MET API was a novel application and showed me that APIs do not need to be confined to their intended use.
